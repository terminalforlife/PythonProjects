### Description

Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of Python. I much prefer Perl. Perl seems to do many things better, either by being more concise or by just being intelligent, such as Perl's _sane_ string concatenation operator not being the same as a bloody standard _arithmetic operator_! In Python, the lack of standard features -- those you'd expect from just about _any_ programming language -- is also quite frustrating.

However, I am starting to appreciate Python. It certainly seems to excel in some areas. The large Python community is a bonus, and there are _loads_ of modules to use to get things done. The syntax in Python is consistent and focus on formatting helps encourage tidier code.

I have no idea what I'll wind up doing with Python, if anything, but I will share the occasional Python script in this repository, and maybe one day I'll get to the point at which I'll be writing programs in Python. Until then, perhaps you'll find these scripts useful or at least educational.

### Contributions

I'm not looking for PRs in this repository. However, if you're interested in giving me some Python pointers, please post them in the Discussions tab, or, if there's a glaring issue in one of my Python scripts, post an Issue in reference to it.
