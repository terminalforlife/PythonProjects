# Introduction to PythonProjects

I've dabbled in Python a bit in the past, messing with Tk and some simple tasks. However, I wasn't happy with the language, so I moved over to Perl, where I have spent a good year or two of my time, hence the PerlProjects repository. I'm finding it interesting looking at Python again, now that I've gradually eased myself into object-oriented programming.

In my re-entry to and better-attempt at Python, I'll be focusing on at *least* version 3.6, in keeping with modern Python practices.
