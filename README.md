### Description

Unlike my projects in [ShellProjects](https://github.com/terminalforlife/ShellProjects) and [PerlProjects](https://github.com/terminalforlife/PerlProjects), you won't _yet_ find my best work here, but I've been writing Python for a little while and I'm starting to get the hang of it. I'm not Python's biggest fan, but it's certainly growing on me; I can't deny how bloody useful it is.

You won't find many command-line tools here, because Python seems to kind of suck for command-line tools (e.g., `PipeError`!), but for GTK programs, its vast library selection, and other bits and bobs, like Nemo scripts, it can be very nice.

### Contributions

I'm not looking for PRs in this repository. However, if you're interested in giving me some Python pointers, please post them in the Discussions tab, or, if there's a glaring issue in one of my Python scripts, post an Issue in reference to it.
